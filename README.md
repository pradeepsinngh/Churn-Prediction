 Project: Churn Prediction using Machine Learning (PySpark and Scikit-learn)
 Name: Pradeep Singh
 Red ID: 821368893
 
------------------------------
 Project Description:
 Predicting Customer churn rate on Telco Customer churn dataset, taken from kaggale. We'll take a look at what types of customer  data we have, do some preliminary analysis, and develop churn prediction models - all with Python/PySpark and different machine learning frameworks, like, ML Package and Scikit-learn.
 
 The broad idea of this project is to develop machine learning models that could predict churn rate from given data. We will use different tools and methods like, numpy, pandas, seaborn, correlation, etc. to explore, extract and trasnform data.
 
------------------------------
 Dataset:
 Telco Customer Churn Dataset: This dataset consist information of telco's customers. Each row represents a customer, each column contains customerâ€™s attributes described on the column Metadata. There are roughly 7000 customer data with 21 attribute for each customers.

Instructions to run:
- All notebooks are self-sufficient and there is no dependencies among files/ notebooks.
- Project can be divided into 4 folders in chronological order:
  -- /exploratory-data-analysis
  -- /data-transformation
  -- /pyspark       # models
  -- /scikit        # models
- Run all files in these folders in this order to get better idea about the project.
- Other than that, no speical instruction is needed.
